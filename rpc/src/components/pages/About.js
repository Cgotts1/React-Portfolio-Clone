        Currently a UCSD bootcamp student working towards becoming a fullstack
        developer. I have a B.A. in Anthropology as well as a MSc in Forensic
        Anthropology. My goals after completing this course is to find a job
        within the tech industry as a software engineer and then later
        transition into UX research in order to utilize my anthropological
        background. In addition to my passion for learning new skills, I have
        developed a passion for teaching new skills through my work experience
        in the United States K-12 public school system. While teaching can be
        very rewarding, it can also be mentally taxing, so classroom management
        has become an essential tool I rely on daily in order to maintain
        sanity. Below are portfolio's of work that I have accumulated over the
        past few years that share a brief look into my teaching experience,
        anthropological research done in college, and various web applications I
        have developed.

            I am a MSc forensic anthropology graduate student from Liverpool
            John Moores University with a strong background in anthropology. In
            addition to my academic achievements, I have recently graduated from
            a full stack coding bootcamp from UCSD, where I have learned a
            variety of skills related to software development and web
            applications. During my time at the bootcamp, I gained hands-on
            experience with various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. I also became proficient in using frameworks such as
            React and Express, which are commonly used in web development. I
            learned how to build responsive and user-friendly web applications,
            as well as how to collaborate with other developers using Git
            version control. <br></br><br></br>My previous academic experience in anthropology has
            also provided me with a unique set of skills that are valuable in
            the field of forensic anthropology. In particular, I have extensive
            knowledge and practical experience in identifying fragmented human
            remains, developing biological profiles, and recognizing taphonomic
            processes. Additionally, my research has included examining the
            differences between male and female femora, establishing methods to
            assist with commingled remains, and utilizing forensic palynology to
            analyze pollen grains found on articles of clothing. Overall, my
            combination of skills in forensic anthropology and software
            development make me a well-rounded and versatile candidate for a
            variety of roles in both fields.
